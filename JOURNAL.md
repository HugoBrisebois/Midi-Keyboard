## 10/6/2025 12 AM - started the scematic

I started making the schematic and started routing some of the wires to the pi Pico and I am starting to under stand what the tutorial is saying. I am also excited for the PCB design process that will happen soon! I am also wanting to maybe integrate a speaker, although that might not be the best idea.  

## 10/6/2025 2 PM - finished the tutorial for building the schematic  

I think that the schematic is finished although the tutorial was quite confusing at moments like adding audio and making sure that a the pin outs were in the right place. another thing that was quite annoying was the fact that the tutorial was kind of broad in its explanations, so I can't wait to see what comes next!

## 10/9/2025 6 PM - finishing to route the PCB  

I have finally gotten to the point of finishing the PCB, and I only have a few more fixes until i am done. The next thing that needs to be done is designing the case and then i am done. Although i said i might implement a speaker, i decided that it was better not to for costs and complexity. Although i have looked into trying this, i thought against this. another thing that i managed to do is have the correct footprint for the audio output thanks to Arghya Vyas![Screenshot 2025-10-09 143823.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTI2MCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--2de878a83950ea2d881f1ab929bef7774d4bb6c2/Screenshot%202025-10-09%20143823.png)

  

## 10/9/2025 7 PM - Finished routing the PCB  

i have finished the routing of the PCB and i am hoping that i can finish this project extremely soon. the 3D model of the PCB looks quite good too. although, i think that making the case should be the easiest part of the project, i honestly can't wait to start building the actual project and using it!![Screenshot 2025-10-09 152236.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTI2NiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--7a5b8729322077b4d4e7eddf3f628d2723b5c032/Screenshot%202025-10-09%20152236.png)
